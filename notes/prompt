When there are tens or hundreds of thousands of decks, it accurately displays information, however, with the 106 decks currently in the attached file, it shows only 3 ranked decks: Darkrai Arceus in C tier, Buzzwhole EX Pheromosa in E tier and Flareon EX Eevee EX in F tier, and all other decks are unranked. This makes no sense as the Darkrai Arceus deck has a 60.9% win rate and scoring high in popularity. It should definitely be in S tier. Update the code makign impact on smaller deck sizes, but keep the math mostly the same for bigger decks.
