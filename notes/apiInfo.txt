Key Endpoints for Your Use Case

GET /tournaments?game=POCKET
This lists recent tournaments (default: last 50, sorted by date descending). Optional params include limit (e.g., limit=100 for more results) and page for pagination. Each tournament object includes id, name, date, players, and more.

To approximate a timeframe like "4w" (4 weeks), fetch tournaments and filter client-side by the date field (ISO format, e.g., "2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"). You could loop through pages until you hit tournaments older than your cutoff.

GET /tournaments/{id}/standings
For a specific tournament ID from the above, this returns player standings, including deck (with name and ID), record (wins, losses, ties), and full decklist (card details if submitted).

Aggregate across multiple tournaments: Group by deck name to calculate total counts (entries), wins, losses, ties, and derived stats like win %. For example, sum records for each unique deck.

GET /tournaments/{id}/pairings
This gives match details (e.g., player1 vs. player2, winner). Combine with standings to analyze matchups and tournament depth for your Bayesian model.

They also have webhooks for real-time updates on new/finished tournaments, which could automate your data pulls once set up.
